Using the old models
only a few testing images really

random
  TP:   0
  FP:  29
  FN:   0
  TN:  41


salience
  TP:   3
  FP:  40
  FN:   0
  TN:  27


segmentation
  TP:   0
  FP:  31
  FN:   1
  TN:  38


Mick suggests that we should be looking at the quality of crops, rather than relying on glimpse right away. consider it an oracle model. did random, salience, or ncuts do the best job in finding the ground truth bounding boxes?

the update to that would be comparing the power sets of selected regions,
or, in order, a aglomerative view of the boxes (ie, starting with single clusters, then merged groups of 2, then 3, etc).

should start with a different measure of overlap quality. instead of a binary over,under .5, just keep track of the percent overlap. allow us to evaluate more robustly, using ROC view of overlap

if the bounding box is good, maybe just give it the correct classification, let it use this for further petacat development
in fact: maybe just let it automatically correct to the ground truth bounding box that it found





just checking with the new models
random
  TP:   2
  FP:  22
  FN:   0
  TN:  46


salience
  TP:   2
  FP:  30
  FN:   0
  TN:  38


segmentation
  TP:   3
  FP:  29
  FN:   0
  TN:  38


not much use in combining over several runs yet.
stochasticity in salience only comes from energy clustering
stochasticity in segmentation ?
stochasticity in random boxes is from the random boxes
